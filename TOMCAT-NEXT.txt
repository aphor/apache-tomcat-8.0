Notes of things to consider for the next major Tomcat release (probably 8.0.x
but possibly 7.1.x).

 1. Refactor the TLD parsing. TLDs are currently parsed twice. Once by Catalina
    looking for listeners and once by Jasper.

 2. Refactor the XML parsing (org.apache.tomcat.util.xml ?) to remove duplicate
    XML parsing code in Catalina and Jasper such as the entity resolvers used
    for validation.

 3. TLDs may have a many to many relationship between URIs and TLD files. This
    can result in the same TLD file being parsed many times. Refactor the
    TldLocationCache to cache the parsed nodes (will need to check for changes
    to TLD files).

 4. TLD files should be included in the dependencies for JSP and Tag files.

 5. Run the unused code detector and remove everything that isn't currently used.
    Add deprecation markers for the removed code to Tomcat 7.0.x
    - Complete for javax.*
    - Complete for o.a.catalina.[ant to startup]
    - Remaining code in progress

 6. Change the default URIEncoding on the connector to UTF-8.

 7. Rip out all the JNDI code in resource handling and replace it with straight
    URLs (File or WAR).
    Supporting re-factoring to consider arising from the above
    - Move Mapper from Connector to Service (saves duplication)
    - Remove Mapper from Context - use Mapper from Service

 8. Review the connector shutdown code for timing and threading issues
    particularly any that may result in a client socket being left open after a
    connector.stop().

 9. Remove the svn keywords from all the files. (Just Java files?)

10. Code to the interfaces in the o.a.catalina package and avoid coding directly
    to implementations in other packages. This is likely to require a lot of
    work. Maybe use Structure 101 (or similar) to help.

11. Merge Service and Engine

12. Java 7 updates
    - Use of <> operator where possible
      - Complete for javax.*
      - Complete for o.a.catalina.[ant to startup]
      - Not started for remainder
    - Use of try with resources
      - Not started
    - Catching multiple exceptions
      - Not started

13. Fix all FindBugs warnings
    - Complete for javax.*
    - Complete for o.a.catalina.[ant to startup]
    - Remaining code in progress
