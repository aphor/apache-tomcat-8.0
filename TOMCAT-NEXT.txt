Notes of things to consider for the next major Tomcat release (probably 8.0.x
but possibly 7.1.x).

1. Refactor the TLD parsing. TLDs are currently parsed twice. Once by Catalina
   looking for listeners and once by Jasper.

2. Refactor the XML parsing (org.apache.tomcat.util.xml ?) to remove duplicate
   XML parsing code in Catalina and Jasper such as the entity resolvers used for
   validation.

3. TLDs may have a many to many relationship between URIs and TLD files. This
   can result in the same TLD file being parsed many times. Refactor the
   TldLocationCache to cache the parsed nodes (will need to check for changes to
   TLD files).

4. TLD files should be included in the dependencies for JSP and Tag files.

5. Run the unused code detector and remove everything that isn't currently used.
   Add deprecation markers for the removed code to Tomcat 7.0.x

6. Change the default URIEncoding on the connector to UTF-8.

7. Rip out all the JNDI code in resource handling and replace it with straight
   URLs (File or WAR).

8. Review the connector shutdown code for timing and threading issues
   particularly any that may result in a client socket being left open after a
   connector.stop().

9. Remove the svn keywords from all the files. (Just Java files?)
