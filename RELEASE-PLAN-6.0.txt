                      Release Plan for Apache Tomcat 6.0
                      ==================================


Introduction:
------------

This document is a release plan for the final release of Apache Tomcat 6.0.

The goal of the Apache Tomcat 6.0 final release is to provide a stable
container that supports 100% of the mandatory requirements of the Servlet 2.5
and JSP 2.1 specifications, as well as to improve and add many useful 
additional features on top of the existing Apache Tomcat 5.5.x releases.

Apache Tomcat 6.0 includes the following major new features over 
Apache Tomcat 5.5:

    * Servlet 2.5 implementation
    * JSP 2.1 implementation
    * Unified EL 2.1 implementation, which may be used independently
    * Pluggable JEE 5 annotation support for Servlet & JSP
    * Refactored session clustering implementation
    * New asynchronous IO capabilities and API
    * Simpler distribution layout

Apache Tomcat 6.0 will use the build numbering and release process first used 
in the Apache HTTPd 2.0.x project.
Milestone builds, numbered 6.0.x, will be released as needed and will 
recieve a stability rating after a one week testing period. The rating can be
either: Alpha, Beta, or Stable.

This Release Plan proposes the following prospective target dates 
for stability:

  October 20, 2006

Tomcat 6.0.0 should be tagged by this date.
