    <subsection name="Tomcat Snapshots">
      Tomcat snapshots are located in the 
      <a href="http://people.apache.org/repo/m2-snapshot-repository/org/apache/tomcat/">Apache Snapshot Repository</a>.
      The official URL is <source>http://people.apache.org/repo/m2-snapshot-repository/org/apache/tomcat/</source><br/>
      Snapshots are done periodically, not on a regular basis, but when changes happen and the Tomcat team deems a new snapshot might 
      useful.
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Tomcat Releases">
      At every release, be it alpha, beta or stable, we will publish the JARs to 
      <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/dev/dist/m2-repository/org/apache/tomcat/">Tomcat's Staging Repository</a>.
      The URL for this is <source>http://tomcat.apache.org/dev/dist/m2-repository/org/apache/tomcat/</source>.<br/>
      At some point, this URL will change over to ASF's main repository that synchronizes with IBiblio.<br/>
      When that happens, all releases will be moved over, and this repository will stick around for a while, but no
      new releases will be published to the staging repository.
