  Subsection ordering:
  General, Catalina, Coyote, Jasper, Cluster, Web applications, Extras, Tribes,
  Other

  Item Ordering:

  Fixes having an issue number are sorted by their number, ascending.

  There is no ordering by add/update/fix.

  Other fixed issues are added to the end of the list, chronologically.
  They eventually become mixed with the numbered issues. (I.e., numbered
  issues to not "pop up" wrt. others).

  Until the first Tomcat 8.0.0 release, only changes not back-ported to 7.0.x
  should be listed here.
